# Team Member Setup Guide - IAM Users

## Quick Setup for Team Lead

Create IAM users with temporary passwords for all team members in one command.

---

## Step 1: Create Team IAM Users

Run the automated script:

```bash
cd data_viz
bash scripts/create_team_users.sh
```

### What This Does

Creates IAM users for:
- **javi** (username: `aier-javi`)
- **shay** (username: `aier-shay`)
- **cuoung** (username: `aier-cuoung`)
- **cyberdog** (username: `aier-cyberdog`)
- **crystal** (username: `aier-crystal`)

Each user gets:
1. ‚úÖ IAM username with `aier-` prefix
2. ‚úÖ Temporary password (must change on first login)
3. ‚úÖ AWS CLI access keys (for command line)
4. ‚úÖ Developer policy with appropriate permissions
5. ‚úÖ Credentials file saved in `team-credentials/`

### Permissions Granted

Team members can:
- ‚úÖ Full access to S3 buckets (`aier-*`)
- ‚úÖ Full access to DynamoDB tables (`aier-*`)
- ‚úÖ Full access to Lambda functions (`aier-*`)
- ‚úÖ Read/write CloudWatch logs
- ‚úÖ View CloudFront distributions
- ‚úÖ View their own IAM user info
- ‚úÖ Run all Terraform scripts
- ‚úÖ Deploy and destroy infrastructure

Team members cannot:
- ‚ùå Create new IAM users
- ‚ùå Modify billing settings
- ‚ùå Delete other users' resources
- ‚ùå Access root account

---

## Step 2: Distribute Credentials

### Credentials Files Created

After running the script, check:
```bash
ls -1 team-credentials/
```

You'll see:
```
javi-credentials.txt
shay-credentials.txt
cuoung-credentials.txt
cyberdog-credentials.txt
crystal-credentials.txt
```

### Secure Distribution Methods

**Option 1: Encrypted Email**
- Use encrypted email service (ProtonMail, etc.)
- Attach credential file
- Send to team member

**Option 2: Password Manager**
- Use 1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden shared vault
- Upload credential file
- Share with specific team member

**Option 3: Secure Messaging**
- Use Signal, WhatsApp (disappearing messages)
- Send credentials in separate messages
- Never use unencrypted channels

**Option 4: In-Person/Video Call**
- Share screen showing credentials
- Team member writes down manually
- Delete after confirmed

### ‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER:
- ‚ùå Commit credentials to Git
- ‚ùå Post in public Slack/Discord channels
- ‚ùå Send via unencrypted email
- ‚ùå Share in screenshots
- ‚ùå Upload to cloud storage

---

## Step 3: Team Members - First Login

### For AWS Console (Browser)

Each team member receives a credentials file with:

**Example:**
```
AWS Console Login:
URL: https://console.aws.amazon.com/
Account ID: 123456789012
IAM Username: aier-javi
Temporary Password: Abc123!@#XyzQwerty
```

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/
2. Choose "IAM user"
3. Enter Account ID: `123456789012`
4. Click "Next"
5. Enter IAM Username: `aier-[yourname]`
6. Enter Temporary Password (from credentials file)
7. **System will force password change**
8. Create new strong password (min 8 characters)
9. Confirm new password
10. You're in!

### For AWS CLI (Command Line)

Each team member gets access keys:

**Example:**
```
AWS CLI Access Keys:
AWS Access Key ID: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS Secret Access Key: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
Region: us-east-1
```

**Steps:**
1. Open terminal
2. Navigate to project: `cd AIER-alerts`
3. Run setup script:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/aws-setup-mac.sh
   ```
4. When prompted, enter:
   - Access Key ID: [from credentials file]
   - Secret Access Key: [from credentials file]
   - Region: `us-east-1`
5. Verify:
   ```bash
   aws sts get-caller-identity
   ```
6. Should show your IAM username

---

## Step 4: Verify Team Access

### Team Lead Verification

Check all users created:
```bash
aws iam list-users --query 'Users[?contains(UserName, `aier`)].UserName' --output table
```

Expected output:
```
-------------------
|   ListUsers     |
+------------------+
|  aier-javi      |
|  aier-shay      |
|  aier-cuoung    |
|  aier-cyberdog  |
|  aier-crystal   |
+------------------+
```

Check user permissions:
```bash
aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name aier-javi
```

### Team Member Verification

Each member runs:
```bash
# Check identity
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Check S3 access
aws s3 ls

# Check DynamoDB access
aws dynamodb list-tables

# Check Lambda access
aws lambda list-functions
```

If all commands work without errors, access is properly configured!

## Complete Team Workflow

### Team Lead (One-Time Setup)

## Security Best Practices

### Password Requirements

When changing from temporary password:
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least 1 uppercase letter
- At least 1 lowercase letter
- At least 1 number
- At least 1 special character (!@#$%^&*)

### Access Key Rotation

Every 90 days:
```bash
# List current keys
aws iam list-access-keys --user-name aier-[yourname]

# Create new key
aws iam create-access-key --user-name aier-[yourname]

# Update local config with new keys
bash scripts/aws-setup-mac.sh

# Delete old key
aws iam delete-access-key --user-name aier-[yourname] --access-key-id [OLD_KEY_ID]
```

### MFA (Optional but Recommended)

Enable multi-factor authentication:
1. Log into AWS Console
2. Go to IAM ‚Üí Users ‚Üí [your username]
3. Security credentials tab
4. Click "Assign MFA device"
5. Follow setup with authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Access Denied" Error

**Problem**: Can't access AWS services
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check current identity
aws sts get-caller-identity

# If shows different user, reconfigure
bash scripts/aws-setup-mac.sh

# Verify policy attached
aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name aier-[yourname]
```

### "Invalid Credentials" Error

**Problem**: Access keys don't work
**Solution**:
1. Verify you copied keys correctly (no extra spaces)
2. Check credentials file in `~/.aws/credentials`
3. Reconfigure: `bash scripts/aws-setup-mac.sh`
4. Contact team lead if keys need to be regenerated

### Can't Log Into Console

**Problem**: Password doesn't work
**Solution**:
1. Double-check username format: `aier-[yourname]`
2. Verify Account ID: `123456789012`
3. Use temporary password from credentials file (first login)
4. Contact team lead to reset password if needed

### Password Reset Required

**Problem**: Console forces password change
**Solution**: This is normal! Create new strong password when prompted.

---

## Removing Team Access (Project End)

When project is complete:

```bash
# Delete all team IAM users
bash scripts/delete_team_users.sh

# Type 'delete' to confirm
```

This removes:
- All IAM users
- Their access keys
- Their console login
- Their permissions

The developer policy remains (can be deleted manually if needed).
