## Key Talking Points

### Problem
"Healthcare systems need resilient infrastructure for patient monitoring."

### Solution
"We've built a complete AWS-based system with:
- Infrastructure automation (Terraform)
- Secure team access (IAM users)
- Real medical data (Kaggle dataset)
- Complete documentation
- DevSecOps practices"

### Technology
"Built with:
- AWS (S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, CloudFront)
- Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)
- Python (FastAPI backend, data pipeline)
- TypeScript + Vue.js (frontend)
- Security-first design"

### Team Collaboration
"Each team member:
