# Security Incident & Resolution

**Date**: September 29, 2024, 8:44 PM  
**Issue**: Credentials displayed in terminal output  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

---

## What Happened

During initial team user creation, the script displayed IAM credentials in terminal output, which exposed:
- **User**: aier-javi
- **Access Key ID**: AKIAEXAMPLEDELETED (now DELETED)
- **Secret Access Key**: [exposed in terminal] (now INVALID)

**Impact**: Credentials visible in chat/terminal history

---

## Immediate Actions Taken

### 1. Deleted Exposed Key ✅
```bash
aws iam delete-access-key --user-name aier-javi \
  --access-key-id AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
```

**Result**: Old key is now invalid and cannot be used

### 2. Generated New Key Securely ✅
```bash
aws iam create-access-key --user-name aier-javi \
  --output json > /tmp/javi-new-keys.json
```

**Result**: New key saved to file only (not displayed)

### 3. Updated Script ✅
Modified `scripts/create_team_users.sh` to NOT display keys in terminal output.

---

## New Secure Process

### How Credentials Are Now Handled

1. ✅ **Generated**: Keys created via AWS API
2. ✅ **Saved**: Written directly to credential files
3. ✅ **NOT Displayed**: Never echo'd to terminal
4. ✅ **Distributed**: Sent via secure channels only
5. ✅ **Deleted**: Credential files deleted after distribution

### Updated Script Behavior

**Old** (insecure):
```bash
echo "Access Key: $ACCESS_KEY_ID"  # BAD - displays in terminal
```

**New** (secure):
```bash
# Write directly to file without displaying
# Terminal shows: "✓ Created access keys for CLI (saved to file only)"
```

## Current State of Team Credentials

### Javi (Fixed)
- ❌ Old key: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE (DELETED)
- ✅ New key: Generated and saved to `/tmp/javi-new-keys.json`
- ✅ Needs to be updated in credential file

### Other Team Members (Secure)
- ✅ shay: Keys in credential file (not exposed)
- ✅ cuoung: Keys in credential file (not exposed)
- ✅ cyberdog: Keys in credential file (not exposed)
- ✅ crystal: Keys in credential file (not exposed)

**Note**: Original script run had issue, but keys for shay, cuoung, cyberdog, and crystal were saved to files only and not displayed.

---

## Action Items

### For You (Team Lead)

#### 1. Update Javi's Credential File
```bash
# Get new keys
cat /tmp/javi-new-keys.json

# Manually update: ../team-credentials/javi-credentials.txt
# Replace old access key ID and secret with new ones from JSON
```

#### 2. Verify All Other Credentials Are Secure
```bash
# These should be safe (not displayed in terminal)
cat ../team-credentials/shay-credentials.txt
cat ../team-credentials/cuoung-credentials.txt
cat ../team-credentials/cyberdog-credentials.txt
cat ../team-credentials/crystal-credentials.txt
```

#### 3. Commit Script Fix
```bash
cd /Volumes/Exchange/projects/capstone/data_viz
git add scripts/create_team_users.sh
git commit -m "Security: Prevent credentials from displaying in terminal output"
```

## Lessons Learned

### ❌ DON'T
- Display credentials in terminal output
- Echo secret keys or passwords
- Show credentials in logs
- Display sensitive data in scripts

### ✅ DO
- Save credentials directly to files
- Use file redirection (> filename.json)
- Hide output with `2>&1 > /dev/null` when appropriate
- Show only status messages ("✓ Created")

---

## Preventing Future Exposure

### Best Practices

1. **Never display credentials**:
   ```bash
   # BAD
   echo "Key: $SECRET_KEY"
   
   # GOOD
   echo "✓ Key created (saved to file)"
   ```

2. **Use file output**:
   ```bash
   # Write directly to file
   aws iam create-access-key --user-name user > keys.json
   ```

3. **Clear terminal history** (optional):
   ```bash
   history -c  # Clear bash history
   ```

4. **Use secure variables**:
   ```bash
   # Don't print variables with credentials
   SECRET_KEY="..." 
   # Never: echo $SECRET_KEY
   ```

---

## Verification

### Confirm Old Key is Deleted
```bash
aws iam list-access-keys --user-name aier-javi
# Should only show NEW key (not AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE)
```

### Confirm New Key Works
```bash
# Team member will test after receiving new credentials
```

---

## Resolution Status

✅ **Exposed key**: Deleted from AWS (invalid)  
✅ **New key**: Generated securely  
✅ **Script**: Fixed to prevent future exposure  
✅ **Other users**: Not affected (keys not displayed)  
✅ **Repository**: No credentials committed  

---

## Summary

**What happened**: Script displayed Javi's credentials in terminal  
**Risk**: Credentials visible in chat history  
**Action**: Deleted old key, generated new one securely  
**Prevention**: Updated script to never display credentials  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - No active security risk  

**Going forward**: All credentials are handled securely without terminal display.
