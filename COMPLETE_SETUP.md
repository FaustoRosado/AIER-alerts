## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

#### 1.1 Create GitHub Repository

Go to: **https://github.com/new**

Settings:
- **Name**: `AIER-alerts`
- **Description**: "AI-Based ER Alert System - Frontend Visualization & Data Pipeline"
- **Visibility**: Public or Private
- **DO NOT** initialize with README

Click **"Create repository"**

#### 1.2 Push Your Code

```bash
cd /Volumes/Exchange/projects/capstone/data_viz

# Add remote (replace [username] with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/[username]/AIER-alerts.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Expected output:
```
Enumerating objects: 67, done.
Counting objects: 100% (67/67), done.
Writing objects: 100% (67/67), done.
To https://github.com/[username]/AIER-alerts.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
```

### Step 2: Distribute Team Credentials

#### 2.1 Send Credentials Securely

**For each team member:**

**Javi:**
```bash
# Send: team-credentials/javi-credentials.txt
# To: javi's email (encrypted) or secure messaging
```

**Shay:**
```bash
# Send: team-credentials/shay-credentials.txt
# To: shay's email (encrypted) or secure messaging
```

**Cuoung:**
```bash
# Send: team-credentials/cuoung-credentials.txt
# To: cuoung's email (encrypted) or secure messaging
```

**Cyberdog (you):**
```bash
# Keep: team-credentials/cyberdog-credentials.txt
# For your own team member access
```

**Crystal:**
```bash
# Send: team-credentials/crystal-credentials.txt
# To: crystal's email (encrypted) or secure messaging
```

#### 2.2 Secure Distribution Methods

**Option 1: Encrypted Email**
- Use ProtonMail, Tutanota, or similar
- Attach credentials file
- Send individually

**Option 2: Secure Messaging**
- Signal (disappearing messages)
- Wire (encrypted)
- Send as text, not file attachment

**Option 3: Password Manager**
- 1Password shared vault
- Bitwarden send
- LastPass secure notes

**Option 4: In-Person/Video**
- Share screen
- Team member copies manually
- Confirm receipt

#### 2.3 After Distribution

```bash
# Delete local credentials folder
cd /Volumes/Exchange/projects/capstone/data_viz
rm -rf team-credentials/

# Verify deleted
ls team-credentials/ 2>&1
# Should show: No such file or directory
```
